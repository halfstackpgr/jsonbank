### JSON BANK
A random brain stormed Idea I got after experimenting with Hikari and Lightbulb to make discord bots. 
```python
print("Welcome To JSON Bank !")
```

*This idea happened to strike my brain when I was trying to figure out a way to make an Economy Bot, but I am lazy enough not to learn operational databases, and hence I decided to make it using JSONs, now the idea was limited to make a bot for my server, but instead I made a library so that everyone can use it. Making their own Economy Bots*
