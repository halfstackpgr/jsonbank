### JSON BANK
A random brain stormed Idea I got after experimenting with Hikari and Lightbulb to make discord bots. 
```python
print("Welcome To JSON Bank !")
```

</div>

*This idea happened to strike my brain when I was trying to figure out a way to make an Economy Bot, but I am lazy enough not to learn operational databases, and hence I decided to make it using JSONs, now the idea was limited to make a bot for my server, but instead I made a library so that everyone can use it. Making their own Economy Bots*


Tested with:
```python
pip install hikari-lightbulb
```

> This library right now, is in the best stable stage with all the "Source" docstrings attached to it. The Bank.py returns two request codes with comment or result. They are 

`200` *for every successfull attempt using a function*

**and**

`400` *for every unsucessfull attempt using a function*
